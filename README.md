# doge - such atom package

Doge is a Atom Package that shows you a picture of doge if your cursor is currently on the word "doge" (See screenshot). This plugin is essential for Doge fans everywhere and everyone who would consider themselves to be "wow."

_Much Atom. So text. wow._

## Installation

You can install the plugin using the following command:

`apm install doge`

or you can go to `preferences -> install` and search for:

`doge`

then simply install it!

## Usage

If you ever want to not be wow, you can always toggle Doge off by either running:

`doge:wow me` in the command palette

or

going to `packages -> doge -> wow me`

both of which toggles Doge on and off.
